# MySQL

This project involves creating a full SQL schema based on the classic Northwind sample database. The schema was built from scratch, including tables, relationships, primary and foreign keys, and appropriate data types to accurately reflect the original dataset.

Once the schema was created and populated with Northwind sample data, a series of SQL queries were written to explore and analyze business data such as sales trends, customer activity, order details, and product performance. This project showcases my understanding of database design, normalization, and writing efficient SQL queries for real-world business scenarios.
